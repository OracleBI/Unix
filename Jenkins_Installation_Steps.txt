Step 1: Install Java Version 8
sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk.x86_64


Step 2: Install Apache Tomcat 9
install wget in not present
sudo yum install wget

Download tar file for Tomcat using below command:
change user to root
wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.0.M10/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.0.M10.tar.gz
sudo groupadd tomcat
sudo mkdir /opt/tomcat
sudo useradd -g tomcat  tomcat
sudo chown tomcat:tomcat tomcat/
sudo tar -zxvf ~/apache-tomcat-9.0.0.M10.tar.gz -C /opt/tomcat --strip-components=1

Setup proper permissions
cd /opt/tomcat
sudo chgrp -R tomcat conf
sudo chmod g+rwx conf
sudo chmod g+r conf/ *
sudo chown -R tomcat logs/ temp/ webapps/ work/
sudo chgrp -R tomcat bin
sudo chgrp -R tomcat lib
sudo chmod g+rwx bin
sudo chmod g+r bin/ *
cd /opt
sudo chown -R tomcat:tomcat tomcat/

sudo su - tomcat
cd /opt/tomcat/conf
vi tomcat-users.xml
Now delete the content of the tomcat-users.xml file. Copy the below block and paste it in tomcat-users.xml file
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
<tomcat-users>
    <role rolename="manager-gui"/>
    <role rolename="manager-script"/>
    <role rolename="manager-jmx"/>
    <role rolename="manager-jmx"/>
    <role rolename="admin-gui"/>
    <role rolename="admin-script"/>
    <user username="edureka" password="edureka" roles="manager-gui,manager-script,manager-jmx,manager-status,admin-gui,admin-script"/>
</tomcat-users>

Start tomcat
cd /opt/tomcat/bin
[tomcat@localhost bin]$ ./startup.sh
Using CATALINA_BASE:   /opt/tomcat
Using CATALINA_HOME:   /opt/tomcat
Using CATALINA_TMPDIR: /opt/tomcat/temp
Using JRE_HOME:        /
Using CLASSPATH:       /opt/tomcat/bin/bootstrap.jar:/opt/tomcat/bin/tomcat-juli.jar
Tomcat started.
[tomcat@localhost bin]$

So, Tomcat has now started.
Now open your browser and access http://localhost:8080 to confirm that Tomcat is up and running.
For your information port 8080 is the default port for Apache Tomcat.


Step 3:Download Jenkins war File
Change to root user and runn below command to download jenkins war file
wget http://updates.jenkins-ci.org/download/war/2.7.3/jenkins.war
mv /root/jenkins.war /home/tomcat
chown tomcat:tomcat /home/tomcat/jenkins.war
chmod u+x /home/tomcat/jenkins.war

Step 4: Deploy Jenkins war File 
To deploy Jenkins war file that you have downloaded in the previous step, open your browser and access localhost:8080 again. Now click on the Manager App.

Note: If you get access denied error do the following:
Commenting the Valve attribute in CATALINA_HOME/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml and restarting Tomcat solve the problem and I can now assess the web manager.shutdown and startup tomcat again.

When you click on the Manager app, it will ask for username and password. If you remember I have given one single username and password for all the roles i.e. edureka. Type the below mentioned username and password and click OK.
Now you will be directed to  Tomcat web application manager page. When you scroll down you will find an option called Deploy. Over here you need to give the context path, i.e. /jenkins and directory URL, i.e. location of the Jenkins war file in your system in my case it is /home/edureka/jenkins.war and finally click on Deploy.

Login to URL and Under Deploy section:
Context Path (required): /Jenkins
XML Configuration file URL:
WAR or Directory URL: /home/tomcat/jenkins.war
Now in the Tomcat web application manager page you can find Jenkins listed under Applications along with other web apps.

Now I will click on “/jenkins”.You will be redireccted to Jenkins page.
When I clicked on jenkins I was directed to Unlock Jenkins page.
================================================================================================================================
Unlock Jenkins

To ensure Jenkins is securely set up by the administrator, a password has been written to the log (not sure where to find it?) and this file on the server:

/home/tomcat/.jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

Please copy the password from either location and paste it below.

================================================================================================================================
Just copy this password and paste it in the Administrator password text-box in the Unlock Jenkins page
Once you have pasted the password, click on continue.
Now I will install plugins.I will go with Install Suggested Plugins.
Once the plugins are installed, you will be directed to a page where you have to Create First Admin User. Please fill your relevant details.After filling this form, click on save and finish.
Jenkins is ready now, once you click on start using Jenkins you will be directed to Jenkins dashboard. You can now use Jenkins to continuously trigger build and test for every change made in the source code.




Step 5: Install Suggested Plugins

Setup a Systemd unit file for Apache Tomcat
As a matter of convenience, you should setup a Systemd unit file for Apache Tomcat:

sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/tomcat.service
Populate the file with:
[Unit]
Description=Apache Tomcat Web Application Container
After=syslog.target network.target

[Service]
Type=forking

Environment=JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jre
Environment=CATALINA_PID=/opt/tomcat/temp/tomcat.pid
Environment=CATALINA_HOME=/opt/tomcat
Environment=CATALINA_BASE=/opt/tomcat
Environment='CATALINA_OPTS=-Xms512M -Xmx1024M -server -XX:+UseParallelGC'
Environment='JAVA_OPTS=-Djava.awt.headless=true -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom'

ExecStart=/opt/tomcat/bin/startup.sh
ExecStop=/bin/kill -15 $MAINPID

User=tomcat
Group=tomcat

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

Save and quit:
:wq
